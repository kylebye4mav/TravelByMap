# TravelByMap

To run, use any method:

    1.) Using an IDE, set MazeGame as the Main class and the IDE's run function after importing.

    2.) Using the command line, run this command: "./gradlew desktop:run"
    Make sure you are in the TravelByMap directory.

    3.) Run start.bat (No promises that batch files will work on MAC OS)

Controls:

    WASD to move.
    Q to rotate counter-clockwise
    E to rotate clockwise
    R to zoom in
    F to zoom out

    WARNING: When rotated, WASD will still act as if you were not rotated at all.
